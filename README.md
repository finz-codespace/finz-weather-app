# Finz Weather App

This is a weather app that allows a user to login and display features to fetch current weather, and historical weather. It also allows the user to associate historical weather information with a real life event (for example: a vacation day), along with date-time information and retrieve it.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to build a weather app that has the following features: 

### Front End (Included in the Assignment)
1. Sign up Page that allows a user to setup first name, last name, email and password.
2. Login Page that allows an exiting user to login.
3. A landing page that shows the following: 
    - Some general user stats like, Full name (first name followed by last name), date-time of last login, and login counts so far.
    - A weather widget that shows a few current weather data features, like temperature, precipitation, wind speed etc.
    - A panel for fetching historical weather data that allows the user to enter latitude, longitude, and date-time to fetch historical weather.

Please code the above frontend features using React components. 
- Keep the React frontend code separated from any backend functionality like calling weather API or interacting with database.
- For the initial iteration just create a set of frontend pages mentioned about without any backend functionality, for example, create the sign up and login pages where sign up / login buttons work without any user inputs and take you to a landing page that contains UI components which use hard coded values. If you want to use JSON objects behind your React components or maintain React state with the useState hook, hard code the backing JSON objects as per your requirements and use them in the state. 

**Note**: Please note that the Backend of this app does not exist as of now. Please make necessary assmptions while developing the Frontend React app and use mocking to simulate any backend APIs you feel would be required. For example you can consider the use of [Mock JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), for mocking the backend.
